Each client will send 5 messages to the server at 1 second intervals. Clients will then wait 5 seconds 
before requesting 10 messages at 1 second intervals. The server will only send messages back to the client
that do not match the requestin client's id. If there are no messages for the client, the server will return 
a struct containing a status code of -1 nd an empty string. If there are messages on the server that do not 
belong to the client, the server will return one at random in a struct along with a status code of 0.
The server only allows 3 unique clients to read and write to the server.
